Insulin acts like a key that allows glucose (fuel) to enter your cells and energise them. The modern diet keeps blood sugar and insulin levels constantly elevated which gradually teaches your cells to become less responseive to insulin's signal. This pernicious loss of sensitivity is known as insulin resistance (IR). The problem with IR is that your cells are unable to effectively intake glucose as fuel. Your body ends up signalling to produce more insulin, but the cells still fail to efficiently burn fuel. This broken signalling presents a myriad of health consequences.

<br/>
#### Broken Energy Signalling

The more insulin resistant one becomes, the more insulin their body produces in an attempt to compensate. Over time, this constant signalling disrupts “normal” metabolic function. Insulin normally directs glucose to the muscles for oxidation, to the liver for storage (as glycogen) and to your fat cells for storage (as triglycerides). At the same time, it shuts off the signal to burn fat. When this system is typically healthy your body is able to switch fuels efficiently by burning carbohydrates during meals and burning fat in-between them. With IR, this flexibility is lost. The cells stop responding to insulin and the pancreas tries really hard to more of it and force glucose into your cells. This typically keeps **blood-glucose** levels stable for the most part, but elevated **blood-insulin** levels are the key issue often overlooked here. The real consequences of this broken signalling appear in how the major organs respond.

Your muscle tissue responds less to insulin and takes up less sugar after meals, resulting in elevated blood-glucose levels as well as sugar being re-routed for fat storage. Your liver normally responds to insulin by preventing glucose synthesis (gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis). In a person with IR, the liver continues making glucose even when it's not required. Additionally, if you’re eating high calorie meals with elevated insulin your body will send the food into fat storage. Moreso, it also locks that fat in storage making it harder to tap into.

The conclusive note here is that in pernicious fashion, loyal subscription to the modern diet may cause insulin to quietly climb as to keep blood-sugar stable. You might pass the sniff test with a routine glucose check whether through pathology or a CGM (continuous glucose monitor), but it’s very likely you may be in hyperinsulinemia (high insulin) already. Typical indicators include an increase in fatty liver markers, rising triglyceride levels, falling HDL, waist gain and belly fat, post-meal energy slumps, food cravings, brain-fog and afternoon fatigue. Late game hyperinsulinemia eventuates when the pancreas can’t keep up and blood-sugar rises, ultimately causing prediabetes and type II diabetes.

Perhaps most interestingly, many of the symptoms of hyperinsulinemia are the stuff of everyday small talk, yet hardly anyone acknowledges they’re pointing to the same hidden metabolic problem.

#### Mitochondria: Power Generators

The catch with IR isn't just that energy flow is inconsistent, but that it stresses the mitochondria that produce it in the first place. These are the tiny cell organelles responsible for converting glucose into ATP, the actual energy your cells use. When IR becomes problematic, glucose metabolism becomes increasingly wasteful, producing more harmful byproducts in the form of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory molecules.

This constant environment of oxidative stress chips away at the interior of mitochondria. The mitochondrial membranes and enzymes responsible for energy production become damaged. In particular, the mitochondrial DNA (mitochondria have DNA of their own) which isn't protected by a typical cell nucleus can suffer significant stess. Unlike typical nuclear DNA, mitochondrial DNA isn't afforded the same robust repair mechanisms which causes most damage to accumulate over time. As mitochondrial function weakens, the cell becomes less efficient and generating ATP and is more prone to making errors. These mitochondria also make cells even less responsive to insulin resistance, creating a vicious cycle.

Furthermore, oxidative stress and chronic hyperinsulinemia have particular epigenetic influences and can cause significant changes in gene expression. These changes can ultimately reprogram a cell into a dysfunctional metabolic state. In effect, IR doesn't just cause short term challenges, it can lock in long-term patters of poor energy metabolism across essentially every type of cell.

When this happens systemically, every organ is affected. But the brain suffers most of all, because it's so energy-intensive.

#### Brain & Mental Health

Consider how we are super conscious as a society about the impact of what we eat on our physicality. Not so often do we hear similar conversations about the cognitive implications of nutrition. Your brain is ~2% of your body weight, but uses ~20% of your energy 24/7, 365. It needs steady, clean power to keep hundreds of billions of neurons firing in sync. If this power delivery suffers, your thinking, mood, sleep and focus suffer too.

Firstly, most brain cells (neurons) use GLUT1/GLUT3 transporters (channel proteins) to pull glucose in without insulin present. This sounds great, because insulin resistance shouldn’t impact brain energy, right? The catch is that even though glucose uptake is ensured, insulin helps regulate how glucose is processed (how efficiently mitochondria oxidise it, and how stable the ATP supply is). IR results in significantly more wasteful neuronal glucose metabolism, causing higher oxidative stress per unit of energy. The subsequently produced inflammatory molecules interfere with neuron activity resulting in irregular neuron firing (signals) that can be either hyper-stimulating (anxiety, hyperactivity) or hypo-stimulating (brain fog, low motivation, fatigue). Mixtures of the two may present as bipolar patterns like depressive and manic states.

Secondly, we often understand mental illnesses as a product of chemical imbalances in the brain, however, treating these imbalances is far from a surefire way to eradicate them. Being an issue of systemic energy depravation, IR explains how this chemical “imbalance” is just an energy problem at the cellular level. This argument might be considered controversial, but considering mainstream psychiatry is yet to identify a single contributing cause for mental illness, this is a promising field of research.

For example, depression can be explained by underpowered mitochondria unable to sustain the circuits for motivation and reward due to the inability to produce critical neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine, serotonin). Anxiety can be explained by inflamed and overexcited neurons misfiring in circuits that regulate our fear response. Bipolar disorder can be understood as swings between both overexcited and under-excited states. Also, in neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease) chronic IR and mitochondrial dysfunction prevent the brain from forming and maintaining new and existing neural pathways.

#### In Conclusion

Insulin resistance isn’t just quietly planning your funeral with diabetes (type II) and weight gain; it destabilises the metaphorical energy grid and nowhere is that more dangerous than in the brain. The inability of mitochondria to burn clean fuel consistently leads to misfiring neurons, unstable neural pathways and poor mental health outcomes. Psychiatry has framed these outcomes as a “chemical imbalance”, which may in fact be an energy imbalance at the cellular level. Beyond the brain, IR can explain damaged blood vessels, irregular hormones, fat accumulation and even increased cancer risk. Insulin resistance is not just about diabetes; it’s the common denominator linking together countless modern health problems.
