I recently attended a Bitcoin event in Palm Cove, QLD earlier this month in August. Personally I've never been confident at public speaking but I took the opportunity to volunteer as a speaker and talk about something I'm deeply passionate about in front of 100+ people. It was a huge success; I got overwhelmingly positive feedback and I couldn't be more proud of myself. I'm very grateful for all the love and support I received from my family, colleagues at work, and those in the community. The topic of choice was an exploration of how Bitcoin and meditation are awfully similar in their epistemological promises. Below is a written summary of the talk I gave:

### Timestamping Enlightenment (Written Summary)

#### 1. Introduction

First of all, let's acknowledge the fact that the truth is inherently good. Knowing what's true is helpful, and spreading what's true is helpful. It never hurt anybody to beleive smoking cigarettes was harmful, or that drinking water was a good thing. With that out of the way, my motivations for giving such a talk boil down to who I am as a person. Truth is important to me, both external and internal. The world I experience within reveals truths about how I experience the world outside, and understanding both helps navigate the trecharous timelines of reality in praxis.

Back in 2024 I attended two Vipassana meditation retreats ([Vipassana](https://www.dhamma.org/en/index) is a meditation technique) lasting 10 days. You head to a homestead a few hours from the city and prepare for:
- no reading
- no writing
- no talking
- no electronics
- eleven hours of *daily* meditation

#### 2. Engines of Truth

This is a nice segue into the idea of truth engines. That is to say: *what mechanisms do we have to seek truth?*. I present two here; both Bitcoin and meditation! Bitcoin is a truth-seeking engine in that it verifies external consensus reality by employing mathematical and cryptographic algorithms to ensure consensus can be maintained. The agreed upon consensus is what set of transactions, accounts and balances are **true**. Meditation, in contrast, is a truth-seeking engine in that it verifies internal experiential reality. By spending enough time in your thoughts you can begin to verify how exactly it is that your brain interprets your reality.

For example, you might get into a car accident and from that moment onward your brain can chose to interpret that in many different ways. How it does so determines your emotional response, and in saying so, the quality of your life at that particular time. Simply being aware of how your mind interprets your reality is enough to exercise your agency about how you'll manage that. So in summary Bitcoin can be thought of as *trust minimised*, whereas meditation is more *truth transcended*. There is a famous and ancient Buddhist scripture known as the Kalama Sutta (here in the west) which stresses that we shouldn't realy on tradition, scripture, logic, consensus, authority, etc... which comments on the value of verification through lived experience and the freedom to doubt. This goes to show that humans have been contemplating philosophy as it concerns truth at least 2500 years ago.

#### 3. Jelly Beans

Back in 2024 around christmas time my workplace was holding a "guess the number of jellybeans in the jar" competition. Now, there's this idea called **wisdom of the crowd** which I found to be quite fitting here. It basically says that the collective judgement of a diverse group of individuals is always going to be a better bet than the judgement of one of those individuals *on average*. Part of this competition was that all the guesses were noted on a public ledger: right on a sheet of paper beside the jar. Ethan decided to go right ahead and take note of that data to produce the following analysis (naturally):

The point here is to demonstrate that an engine of truth can exist within a collective group of thought—a network effect, much like the free market. It's impossible to play central banker and guess the optimal interest rate for an economy; it would be more appropriate and prudent to allow the free market to converge on that rate as it results from the individual economic decision-making of every agent within that market/economy.

#### 4. The Eightfold Path 

The Eightfold path would be very familiar to almost any Buddhist practicioner. It lays out the path one can expect to travel with the ultimate goal of reaching enlightenment. This is a path illuminated by the Buddha about 2500 years ago when it was first beleived to be discovered (i.e. when enlightenment was first achieved). The path does have eight distinct stations, of which we can categorise three broader sections:
- Morality
- Concentration
- Wisdom

The idea is that to reach enlightenment we must found our meditative practice in good morals (morality). This allows a pure mind to then develop the faculty of concentration through their effortful and diligent commitment to their practice. This faculty is what one will ultimately leverage to unearth insight (wisdom) into the nature of their being. This wisdom is the crux of our discussion about truth, so please pay close attention. See below the three components of wisdom, or insight as it's commonly referred to. To explain them I'll use a simple example: imagine going to chatGPT and asking for a recipe from a set of limited ingredients you had available in your fridge at the time. It gives you something which you initially respond to with suspicion. You're never going to end up with a meal unless you take that first step and have **faith** in the recipe. You'll read it one more time and start to think about whether the ingredients and method seem **reasonable** to you. Throughout the process up until the very end you'll be **experiencing** the meal itself which in this case is the ultimate form of wisdom. There is no higher truth to you (subjectively) regarding the reality of that recipe and the meal it created. In that sense, experiences are where wisdom lies, and as a meditator, insight into one's inner being is the ultimate truth.

To link this with Bitcoin is quite simple yet non-obvious to someone who hasn't yet *experienced* Bitcoin's ecosystem. To use a personal anecdote: I had started out with little faith in Bitcoin as an idea. To me, it was just a speculative vehicle. At some point I came across some information which planted a seed from which faith was able to cultivate. If it weren't for Michael Saylor and one fateful YouTube video I would never have springboarded from faith and travelled my so called "orange path" to enlightenment. I of course had to spend years reasoning about my faith before I built a conviction strong enough to motivate full immersion in the ecosystem. It was after doing this that I truly *felt* what it was like to live under a Bitcoin standard.

To explain what enlightenment is would be paradoxical as it's a direct experience beyond concepts, words or dualities. It would be like attempting to describe the colour blue to someone who's never had the faculty of vision—you inevitably fall short, because language is built out of distinctions, and the state being described is said to transcend those distinctions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a concrete socioeconomic structure, yet both reshape one's frame of reference so thoroughly that before-and-after worlds feel incommensurable. Enlightenment dissolves the lens of ego or "self", whereas Bitcoin dissolves the lens of fiat money, inflation, and debt-based finance. I can sit here and explain Bitcoin's mechanics (just like meditative techniques), but the *felt change*, e.g. lowering your time preference, a new sense of sovereignty and detatchment from fiat volatility resists complete explanation. I often find people describe Bitcoin as cultish, precisely because the change is experiential (wisdom), not just intellectial (reason).
