I recently attended a Bitcoin event in Palm Cove, QLD earlier this month in August. Personally I've never been confident at public speaking but I took the opportunity to volunteer as a speaker and talk about something I'm deeply passionate about in front of 100+ people. It was a huge success; I got overwhelmingly positive feedback and I couldn't be more proud of myself. I'm very grateful for all the love and support I received from my family, colleagues at work, and those in the community. The topic of choice was an exploration of how Bitcoin and meditation are awfully similar in their epistemological promises. Below is a written summary of the talk I gave:

### Timestamping Enlightenment (Written Summary)

First of all, let's acknowledge the fact that the truth is inherently good. Knowing what's true is helpful, and spreading what's true is helpful. It never hurt anybody to beleive smoking cigarettes was harmful, or that drinking water was a good thing. With that out of the way, my motivations for giving such a talk boil down to who I am as a person. Truth is important to me, both external and internal. The world I experience within reveals truths about how I experience the world outside, and understanding both helps navigate the trecharous timelines of reality. In my own time I'm both a "node-runner" and a meditator, the former of which involves running an implementation of the Bitcoin software on a Raspberry Pi and the latter of which involves me sitting on a cushion every day.

Back in 2024 I attended two Vipassana meditation retreats ([Vipassana](https://www.dhamma.org/en/index) is a meditation technique) lasting 10 days. You head to a homestead a few hours from the city and prepare for:
- no reading
- no writing
- no talking
- no electronics
- eleven hours of *daily* meditation
