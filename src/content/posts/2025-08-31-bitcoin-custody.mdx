I recently attended a Bitcoin event in Palm Cove, QLD earlier this month in August. Personally I've never been confident at public speaking but I took the opportunity to volunteer as a speaker and talk about something I'm deeply passionate about in front of 100+ people. It was a huge success; I got overwhelmingly positive feedback and I couldn't be more proud of myself. I'm very grateful for all the love and support I received from my family, colleagues at work, and those in the community. The topic of choice was an exploration of how Bitcoin and meditation are awfully similar in their epistemological promises. Below is a written summary of the talk I gave:

### Timestamping Enlightenment (Written Summary)

<br/>
#### 1. Introduction

First of all, let's acknowledge the fact that the truth is inherently good. Knowing what's true is helpful, and spreading what's true is helpful. It never hurt anybody to believe smoking cigarettes was harmful, or that drinking water was a good thing. With that out of the way, my motivations for giving such a talk boil down to who I am as a person. Truth is important to me, both external and internal. The world I experience within reveals truths about how I experience the world outside, and understanding both helps navigate the treacherous timelines of reality in praxis.

Back in 2024 I attended two Vipassana meditation retreats ([Vipassana](https://www.dhamma.org/en/index) is a meditation technique) lasting 10 days. You head to a homestead a few hours from the city and prepare for:
- no reading
- no writing
- no talking
- no electronics
- eleven hours of *daily* meditation

<br/>
#### 2. Engines of Truth

This is a nice segue into the idea of truth engines. That is to say: *what mechanisms do we have to seek truth?*. I present two here; both Bitcoin and meditation! Bitcoin is a truth-seeking engine in that it verifies external consensus reality by employing mathematical and cryptographic algorithms to ensure consensus can be maintained. The agreed upon consensus is what set of transactions, accounts and balances are **true**. Meditation, in contrast, is a truth-seeking engine in that it verifies internal experiential reality. By spending enough time in your thoughts you can begin to verify how exactly it is that your brain interprets your reality. 

![Engines of Truth](/images/timestamping-enlightenment/engines-of-truth.png)

For example, you might get into a car accident and from that moment onward your brain can chose to interpret that in many different ways. How it does so determines your emotional response, and in saying so, the quality of your life at that particular time. Simply being aware of how your mind interprets your reality is enough to exercise your agency about how you'll manage that. So in summary Bitcoin can be thought of as *trust minimised*, whereas meditation is more *truth transcended*. There is a famous and ancient Buddhist scripture known as the Kalama Sutta (here in the west) which stresses that we shouldn't rely on tradition, scripture, logic, consensus, authority, etc... which comments on the value of verification through lived experience and the freedom to doubt. This goes to show that humans have been contemplating philosophy as it concerns truth at least 2500 years ago.

#### 3. Jelly Beans

Back in 2024 around Christmas time my workplace was holding a "guess the number of jellybeans in the jar" competition. Now, there's this idea called **wisdom of the crowd** which I found to be quite fitting here. It basically says that the collective judgement of a diverse group of individuals is always going to be a better bet than the judgement of one of those individuals *on average*. Part of this competition was that all the guesses were noted on a public ledger: right on a sheet of paper beside the jar. Ethan decided to go right ahead and take note of that data to produce the following analysis (naturally):

The point here is to demonstrate that an engine of truth can exist within a collective group of thought—a network effect, much like the free market. It's impossible to play central banker and guess the optimal interest rate for an economy; it would be more appropriate and prudent to allow the free market to converge on that rate as it results from the individual economic decision-making of every agent within that market/economy.

<br/>
#### 4. The Eightfold Path 

The Eightfold path would be very familiar to almost any Buddhist practitioner. It lays out the path one can expect to travel with the ultimate goal of reaching enlightenment. This is a path illuminated by the Buddha about 2500 years ago when it was first believed to be discovered (i.e. when enlightenment was first achieved). The path does have eight distinct stations, of which we can categorise three broader sections:
- Morality
- Concentration
- Wisdom

The idea is that to reach enlightenment we must found our meditative practice in good morals (morality). This allows a pure mind to then develop the faculty of concentration through their effortful and diligent commitment to their practice. This faculty is what one will ultimately leverage to unearth insight (wisdom) into the nature of their being. This wisdom is the crux of our discussion about truth, so please pay close attention. See below the three components of wisdom, or insight as it's commonly referred to. To explain them I'll use a simple example: imagine going to ChatGPT and asking for a recipe from a set of limited ingredients you had available in your fridge at the time. It gives you something which you initially respond to with suspicion. You're never going to end up with a meal unless you take that first step and have **faith** in the recipe. You'll read it one more time and start to think about whether the ingredients and method seem **reasonable** to you. Throughout the process up until the very end you'll be **experiencing** the meal itself which in this case is the ultimate form of wisdom. There is no higher truth to you (subjectively) regarding the reality of that recipe and the meal it created. In that sense, experiences are where wisdom lies, and as a meditator, insight into one's inner being is the ultimate truth.

![Wisdom](/images/timestamping-enlightenment/wisdom.png)

To link this with Bitcoin is quite simple yet non-obvious to someone who hasn't yet *experienced* Bitcoin's ecosystem. To use a personal anecdote: I had started out with little faith in Bitcoin as an idea. To me, it was just a speculative vehicle. At some point I came across some information which planted a seed from which faith was able to cultivate. If it weren't for Michael Saylor and one fateful YouTube video I would never have springboarded from faith and travelled my so called "orange path" to enlightenment. I of course had to spend years reasoning about my faith before I built a conviction strong enough to motivate full immersion in the ecosystem. It was after doing this that I truly *felt* what it was like to live under a Bitcoin standard.

To explain what enlightenment is would be paradoxical as it's a direct experience beyond concepts, words or dualities. It would be like attempting to describe the colour blue to someone who's never had the faculty of vision—you inevitably fall short, because language is built out of distinctions, and the state being described is said to transcend those distinctions. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a concrete socioeconomic structure, yet both reshape one's frame of reference so thoroughly that before-and-after worlds feel incommensurable. Enlightenment dissolves the lens of ego or "self", whereas Bitcoin dissolves the lens of fiat money, inflation, and debt-based finance. I can sit here and explain Bitcoin's mechanics (just like meditative techniques), but the *felt change*, e.g. lowering your time preference, a new sense of sovereignty and detachment from fiat volatility resists complete explanation. I often find people describe Bitcoin as cultish, precisely because the change is experiential (wisdom), not just intellectual (reason).

#### 5. Timestamping Enlightenment

Time for a small technical detour. If you pay somebody on the Bitcoin network you have the option of including some additional miscellaneous data with your transaction up to the size of 80 bytes at the time of writing. When your transaction gets included in a block, that data is there forever—immutable. The beauty of this is revealed when we take a hash function and realise we can reduce an input of any size, say, the Bible, and reduce it down to a single string less than 80 bytes. If the Pharisees had Bitcoin at the time the Bible was being authored they could have done this, and all it would take to verify that the copy we have today has been maintained in its purity would be to compare the hash of the contemporary version with the first edition.

![Free Speech](/images/timestamping-enlightenment/free-speech.png)

When I was on my second Vipassana meditation retreat I had a burning question for our teacher: *"how could I be sure that the technique, Vipassana, has been maintained in its purity from generation to generation, that the technique I'm being taught was used by the Buddha to achieve enlightenment?"*. Hopefully you can see where this is going by now... My teacher simply replied by saying: *"you don't have to be sure, you don't have to believe, you can verify it yourself through lived experience"*. To be honest I wasn't expecting that answer at all. It was beautiful in its simplicity and I think it nicely captures the title of this discussion. The Buddha could very well have timestamped enlightenment by embedding his teaching in the blockchain 2500 years ago, and there would be zero contention as to whether the technique was pure, only whether it worked.

<br/>
#### 6. Human Truth network

Now is the right moment to turn to our final idea. Bitcoin, at its core, is a network that propagates information across nodes. Each node performs independent verification to confirm that data plays by the protocol's consensus rules. The parallel in human life is strikingly beautiful: we too are nodes, passing information from one mind to the next, each choosing whether (or not) to verify it against our own lived experience. In Bitcoin, consensus is achieved through energy: the measurable work of cryptography and mathematics that keeps the system honest and aligned with healthy incentives. In humans, consensus emerges through another kind of energy: the biological consumption of calories that fuel the chaotic and non-deterministic algorithm that is the human brain. Both are costly processes, necessary for filtering noise, and both aimed at converging on truth.

![Humans Are Nodes](/images/timestamping-enlightenment/humans-are-nodes.png)

The energy "input" in the Bitcoin case is obviously electricity used to run miners and nodes. The input in a human sense is what I like to call *proof-of-attention* as an analogy for Bitcoin's *proof-of-work* algorithm. This cognitive burn we employ to verify ideas that enter the proverbial mempool of information is pivotal in filtering out noise and intellectually empowering oneself. For the engineers out there, we want to increase our SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). In physical systems we either do this by increasing the signal strength or decrease the noise floor. First we assume the network of information cannot change in terms of misinformation density. To decrease the noise floor is to tune your mind, to meditate, to read, to be mindful. This should hopefully help filter though the noise easily without succumbing to it instead (e.g. brain-rot media, porn, drugs, sugar). To increase the signal is to empower the idea being propagated by increasing global awareness such that it should achieve increased ubiquity. This should help the idea/information enter into more frequent conversation and stress the proof-of-attention algorithms more frequently.

Now think about social media. It doesn't amplify truth—it floods your mempool with low-cost spam. The noise floor rises, clarity fades, and consensus fractures. We stop agreeing on what's real, not because truth disappeared, but because our capacity to separate it from noise has been overwhelmed. A quote from a book I was recommended recently captured this collapse perfectly:

*“When opinions cannot be distinguished from facts, when there is no universal standard to determine truth in law, in science, in scholarship, or in reporting the events of the day, when the most valued skill is the ability to entertain, the world becomes a place where lies become true, where people believe what they want to believe.”
— Chris Hedges (quoted in “The Great Taking”)*

Hope is not lost however. The proof-of-attention cost can be raised. Individually, we can commit to deeper practices: meditation, deliberate reading and honest conversations. These acts cultivate intellectual honesty and cognitive resilience. I acknowledge that doing so alone is hard, and that's where Bitcoin shines as a guiding light. For me, Bitcoin hasn't just preserved wealth, it has given me something far more valuable: time. Time I've invested into friends, family, and perhaps most importantly, myself.

![Guiding Light](/images/timestamping-enlightenment/guiding-light.png)

Bitcoin operates as a truth machine, but deep-down its offering us love. By establishing verification as a proxy for trust, it builds relationships on solid ground. And trust—whether between people or machines—is the bedrock of everything meaningful in our lives. I often imagine a future where this trust can scale, where society itself is defined by empathy, honesty, and peaceful coexistence. A network not just of truth propagating machines, but of humans, aligned in truth.

To conclude I would like to leave you with a quote:

*“Truth flourishes when every node, human or machine, spends energy to verify and willingly relay what it learns”*

So next time someone tells you Bitcoin wastes too much energy, just think maybe, just maybe, there's a really important reason why.
