Keto has made a profound impact on my life in ways I didn't expect. My motivations to start were data-driven, which if you know me is no surprise. SiBio offers the market's only continuous ketone monitor which I heard of in March this year from a friend (who's been keto/carnivore for over 6 years). I often feel like I wouldnt've stuck to it if not for a graph on my phone that essentially reflected my insulin levels. Nonetheless I did, and I'm still going 5 months later even though I thought I'd have stopped by now.

Aside from data, the primary motivator was cognitive health. You can read all about how Keto has incredible theraputic potential regarding the treatment of mental health disorders (e.g. anxiety, ADHD, bi-polar disorder, ptsd, depression, scizophrenia, etc.), metabolic disorders (e.g. type 2 diabetes, obesity, thyroid disorders) and neurological disorders (e.g. epilepsy, parkinsons disease, dementia, etc.) which really captivated me as someone who's identified with a subset of these examples. Whether or not scientific rigor has been exercised in earnest is yet to be seen, but the realm of anecdotal claims seems saturated with success. This success was enough to propel me to explore the potential impact keto could have on my (primarily) cognitive and (secondarily) physical health.
