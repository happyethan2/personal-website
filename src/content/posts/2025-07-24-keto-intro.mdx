Keto is a very interesting diet to me because it's one that I've had a very personal and life changing experience with. Initially I did it out of a purely data driven motivation because I wanted to experiment with my ketone levels and see if there would be any affect on my cognition. I had read some things regarding Keto and ADHD and I wanted to experiment to see if my symptoms might be aleviated. Lo and behold that is not what I experienced. I had just entered into a world of existence that felt like nothing I had ever felt before in my entire life.
