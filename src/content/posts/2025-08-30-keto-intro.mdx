Keto has made a profound impact on my life in ways I didn't expect. My motivations were initially data-driven, which if you know me is no surprise. SiBio offers the market's only continuous ketone monitor which I heard of in March this year from a good friend. I often feel like I wouldnt've stuck to it if not for a graph on my phone that continually provides me with feedback. Nonetheless I did, and I'm still going months later even though I thought I'd have stopped by now.

Aside from data, the big motivator was what I heard about cognitive health. Keto's incredible theraputic potential in treating psychiatric disorders captivated my attention. Anxiety, ADHD, bipolar, depression, PTSD—all examples of conditions which might be treatable. The diet also demonstrates great success treating metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes, obesity, thyroid issues, and neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson's and possibly dementia. For someone like me who's identified with a subset of these challenges, the idea that a seemingly simple yet seldom practiced dietary intervention could ripple across countless domains of health was overwhelmingly fascinating once I had begun trying it myself.

Whether or not scientific rigor has been exercised in earnest is yet to be seen, but the realm of anecdotal claims seems saturated with success; enough so to propel me to explore the potential impact keto could have on my mental and physical wellbeing.
