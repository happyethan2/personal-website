Keto has made a profound impact on my life in ways I didn't expect. My motivations to start were data-driven, which if you know me is no surprise. SiBio offers the market's only continuous ketone monitor which I heard of in March this year from a friend (who's been keto/carnivore for over six years). I often feel like I wouldnt've stuck to it if not for a graph on my phone that essentially reflects my insulin levels. Nonetheless I did, and I'm still going 5 months later even though I thought I'd have stopped by now.

Aside from data, the primary motivator was cognitive health. Keto's incredible theraputic potential in mental health really captivated my attention—anxiety, ADHD, bipolar, depression, PTSD—the list goes on. Add to that its role in metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes, obesity, thyroid issues, and neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson's and dementia. For someone like me, who's identified with a subset of these challenges, the idea that a seemingly simple yet unpopular dietary intervention could ripple across so many domains of health was enough to dive in.

Whether or not scientific rigor has been exercised in earnest is yet to be seen, but the realm of anecdotal claims seems saturated with success. This success was enough to propel me to explore the potential impact keto could have on my (primarily) cognitive and (secondarily) physical health. This page is where I'll share my thoughts, insights and results so you can see why I'm experimenting and where it will lead.
