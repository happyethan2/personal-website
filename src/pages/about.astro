    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This site is built with Astro and Tailwind. It pulls together long-form writing, the growing recipe library, and a stats dashboard that tracks ongoing experiments.</p>
    <p>The blog now carries every post, no matter the topic. Recipes have their own home because food is part of the work, and the stats tab captures the numbers behind it all.</p>
