      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I've always been drawn to what sits underneath appearances, the unseen mechanics of life, thought, and meaning. Whether it's the way our lives are orchestrated by currents of political value, how data reveals its silent symmetries, or the way the mind processes it all — I keep searching where my interests collide.

        My name is Ethan. Most of my time is spent in pursuit of clarity. I enjoy breaking apart data, learning new ideas, or sitting still long enough to notice my systematic motivations. My page isn't a portfolio or a self-help guide, rather a window into the world of process; what happens when the mind looks itself in the mirror and asks questions about what's important in life.

        If you're someone who sees the beauty in understanding the world, I hope you find something of yourself here too.
