      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="text-justify">
        I've always been drawn to the deeper enquiry of life. The way in which you'll keep asking "why" something is, until inevitably, no one has an answer. I spend an awful lot of time pursuing the "why" questions that deeply interest me; a place where my motivations to improve physically, and emotionally, collide. In my short time alive I've learnt there's so much to learn about myself, and the world in which I reside, that I couldn't possibly learn it all. Knowing that I'll never reach perfection drives my commitment to self-improvement and sharing what I've learnt with others. If you share my joy in exploring life's intricacies, I hope you'll find something of yourself here too.
